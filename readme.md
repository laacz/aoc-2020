# Advent of Code 2020

Since my memory is as bad as it gets, I have a very fun life. For example, today I decided to revisit [last year's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020), since I have no clue what were the tasks. And it's all new to me :)

So, this time I went with the Python.

It's fun to write, but it's hard to read, if one uses all those itertools, list comprehensions, and other python magic.
